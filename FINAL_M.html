            <p>&nbsp;   The meetup I attended was held at a free open space called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/noisebridge/" style="color: rgb(74, 202, 253);">Noisebridge Hackerspace</a>.  Noisebridge is a hackerspace for technical and creative projects, “do-ocratically” (as it says on its About Us column) run by its members.  They are a non-profit educational institution intended for public benefit.  It is located at 272 Capp Street here in San Francisco and visitors are welcomed with smiles and friendly conversation.</p>    
            <p>&nbsp;   Here at Noisebridge I attended <a href="https://www.meetup.com/noisebridge/events/297625839/" style="color: rgb(74, 202, 253);">Grape Coding</a> hosted by the creator of a new website called <a href="https://grape.codes" style="color: rgb(74, 202, 253);">grape.codes</a>.  It’s a platform that allows creators and programmers/coders to interact more with the content.  You can interact with content, create your own content, and post your content to eventually make money off the content.  It generates an interactive recording or live stream of your screen as you code.  You can share your code with others in real-time and interact with them through video, audio and chat.  Grape.codes currently supports 14 of the most popular languages including Python, C, C++, Go Rust, and Java.  All you have to do on the site is click the 'create' button in the navbar to see the full list of languages this platform supports. Instead of opening several windows while you watch a tutorial, or try to code along, you can achieve this all through one browser window.  In my opinion this is a great idea as it allows the student to interact at their own pace and gives the student/user access to interact with the creator live.</p>  
            <p>&nbsp;   The creator’s name is Ash.  He is originally from Canada and is here currently working for Microsoft.  This site is a project he is working on the side. He was very friendly and open about the website and shared some information on coding and programming.  I wasn't able to stay too long because I had to get back to my children, but I did network with Ash, the creator of this site and was welcomed to join next week. I will attend once I’m done my final project. Overall this was a great experience for me and allowed me to see how the Meetup process works here in San Francisco.  It encouraged me to search for other Meetups and I will be attending more in the future.</p>
